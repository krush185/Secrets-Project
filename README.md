# Secrets-Project
The **Secrets Project** is a web application designed to allow authenticated users to both view and submit anonymous secrets. Built with Node.js and Express, this application features robust user authentication through both local credentials and Google OAuth. Users can register, log in, and securely manage their sessions using `express-session`. Once authenticated, users can access a page to view shared secrets or submit their own, which are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Passwords are securely hashed with `bcrypt` to protect user information, and Google OAuth integration allows for seamless login with Google accounts. The project combines secure authentication practices with a user-friendly interface, enabling a unique platform for sharing and discovering anonymous secrets.
